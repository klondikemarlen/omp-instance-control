# Control Protocol

Own the shared request/response semantics, request identifiers, lifecycle actions, and fresh per-launch instance identity. Keep this contract independent of transport and operating-system paths.

Distinguish request acceptance, busy deferral, action completion, and failure. PID alone cannot identify a launch because native POSIX restart can retain it.

`index.js` defines version 1: `{version, instanceId, requestId, action}` requests, with `status` and `restart` actions. Responses match both identities and contain either `{ok: true, data}` or `{ok: false, error: {code, message}}`. Scope includes config root, profile, and effective agent directory, independently of Linux runtime paths. See [shared concepts](../CONCEPTS.md).
